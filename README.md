# # Shopifyyyy!!

I made a clone of the **Shopify** home page using Tailwind and HTML/CSS. I tried to match the colors and fonts as closely as possible to the original page. I found the Tailwind documentation to be very helpful in understanding how to use the framework and how to create responsive designs. However, I did find that there was a lot of scrolling involved in reading the docs, and I was able to pick up a lot of new CSS tricks and techniques. Overall, I'm happy with how the page turned out. It looks very similar to the original one.
